Let me put this as simply and honestly as possible: I wanted to download YouTube videos from time to time. I tried a few online services, but I had to copy and paste the video URLs, open multiple tabs, and go to those online services, which was not easy.

Then I created a bookmarklet that takes the URL of the current tab or allows you to paste a valid URL. It checks if it's a YouTube URL and processes the request by opening the online service and passing the request through a GET request to the online service's URL.
