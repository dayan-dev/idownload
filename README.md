# iDownload
Let me put this as simply and honestly as possible: I wanted to download YouTube videos from time to time. I tried a few online services, but I had to copy and paste the video URLs, open multiple tabs, and go to those online services, which was not easy.

Then I created a bookmarklet that takes the URL of the current tab or allows you to paste a valid URL. It checks if it's a YouTube URL and processes the request by opening the online service and passing the request through a GET request to the online service's URL.


[iDownload](javascript:!function(){var e={iAsk:window.confirm("Do you want to take the opened page address?"),iLocation:window.location.href,Y2mate:"https://www.y2mate.com/download-youtube/",iSupport:["www.youtube.com","youtube.com","youtu.be"]},i={iName:"iDownload",iType:"Bookmarklet",iNumber:"2.8",iAuthor:"Dayan",iUpdated:"05/04/2020",iOfficialWebsite:"'https://github.com/dayan-dev/idownload'"};function o(i){window.open(e.Y2mate+encodeURIComponent(i.substring(i.indexOf("v=")+2)),"Y2mate"),console.log("The URL provided is: '"+decodeURIComponent(i)+"' from Y2mate")}if(console.clear(),console.log("-------------------------"),console.log("Original "+i.iName+" "+i.iType+" by "+i.iAuthor+". Latest "+i.iNumber+" updated on: "+i.iUpdated+".
